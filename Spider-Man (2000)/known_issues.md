# Known Issues v1.0.0
* The MAC version of the game is not supported... ***yet***.
* PAL versions of the game are not supported (and have no current plans to include them).
  * That being said, I might add an automatic pop-up stating as much whenever the auto-splitter detects you're using a PAL version of the game. 
* The N64 version doesn't have the auto-start feature available at the moment (but it might be possible to implement in the future).
* Windows PC and DC versions don't have the auto-start feature available at the moment (and I'm not sure if it's possible to make it work for them. Blame TreyArch).
