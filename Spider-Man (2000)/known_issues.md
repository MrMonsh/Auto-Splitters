# Known Issues v0.9.10
* MAC and N64 Emu versions of the game are not supported... ***yet***.
* PAL versions of the game are not supported (and have no current plans to include them).
  * That being said, I might add an automatic pop-up stating as much whenever the auto-splitter detects you're using a PAL version of the game.
* Windows PC and DC versions don't have auto-start available at the moment (and I'm not sure if it's possible to make it work for them).
