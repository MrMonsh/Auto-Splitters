Auto-Splitter:
This tool will start, split, stop and reset the timer automatically for you, allowing you to focus less on the timer and more on what's important: Drinking Pepsi!

Load Remover:
This tool will allow you to have a second timer in your LiveSplit layout that uses "Game Time". 
This timer will function similar to your current  timer, but the difference is that this one will stop while the game is loading, meaning load times will not count towards your final time of the run.


Installation Guide

1. Open your livesplit
2. Select "Edit Layout"
3. Click on the "+" button, then select "Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter".
4. Select the newly added "Scriptable Auto Splitter", then browse your files and link it to the Pepsiman Load Remover.asl file.
5. [OPTIONAL] Select which functions from the Auto-Splitter you'd like to use. 
6. [OPTIONAL] Change the advanced settings for when the timer should auto-start and when it should auto-split. Each setting will give you more info on what it does by hovering it with the mouse.
-----> In the topic of changing the "Timer Start" advanced settings, I'd personally leave it as-is, given that its set to start on Game Start select at Main Menu (which is how the current ruleset works). I added this just for future-proofing.
7. Click "OK".
8. Click on the "+" button again, but this time select "Timer > Timer".
9. Select the newly added "Timer", then select "Game Time" for the Timing Method option.
10. Click "OK".
11. You're done! Now you can boot up the emulator and run to your heart's content.
